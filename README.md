Shape Calculator Program:
The Shape Calculator program is a versatile Python script that allows users to calculate various properties of different geometric shapes, including rectangles, squares, triangles, and circles. It's a handy tool for anyone needing quick and precise calculations for these common shapes.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter the type of shape they want to calculate: rectangle, square, triangle, or circle. This user-friendly approach ensures that calculations are specific to the chosen shape.Multiple Calculations: Once the shape is selected, the program guides the user through the input process, collecting the necessary measurements, such as lengths, widths, side lengths, bases, heights, or radii, depending on the selected shape.

Extensive Calculations: The program provides a wide range of calculations for each shape: For rectangles, it calculates both area and perimeter.For squares, it calculates both area and perimeter.For triangles, it calculates both area and perimeter, considering the lengths of all three sides.For circles, it calculates area, circumference, and diameter.

Mathematical Accuracy: The code employs the math library in Python to ensure precise mathematical calculations, particularly for circle-related computations involving pi (Ï€).Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented to catch input errors or invalid shape choices. The program guides users to enter correct values or select valid shapes.Usage Example:Here's how you can use this program:Run the script.Enter the shape you want to calculate properties for (e.g., "rectangle").Provide the required measurements (e.g., length and width for a rectangle).Receive instant and accurate results for area, perimeter, and more.
Versatile Applications: This program is not only educational but also practical. It can be used in various scenarios, such as:In construction, to calculate the dimensions of rooms or areas.In educational settings, to teach geometry concepts.For quick calculations in everyday life, such as finding the area of a room's floor or calculating the perimeter of a garden.

Expandability: This code can be further extended by adding support for additional shapes or features. It serves as a strong foundation for anyone interested in exploring more aspects of geometry or developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

Conclusion:

The Shape Calculator program is a powerful Python tool that simplifies geometric calculations for users of all levels. Its clear structure, ease of use, and mathematical precision make it an invaluable resource for students, professionals, and hobbyists alike. Whether you're studying geometry or just need to calculate some dimensions, this program has you covered.
